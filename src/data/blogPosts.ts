          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Why Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance Matters</h2>
          <p>As digital assets become mainstream, governments worldwide have tightened regulations to ensure fair taxation. In the UK, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) considers cryptocurrency as an asset, meaning transactions involving crypto can trigger taxable events. Ignoring these obligations could lead to fines, penalties, or even legal action. By understanding the rules, you can plan your investments more effectively and avoid unnecessary complications.</p>
